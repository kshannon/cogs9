<p><strong>Office Hours</strong><br>
Due to many students living in a different timezone, we will have several office hours spread throughout the week and include early morning, midday, nightime, and weekend hours. This way there should always be a time for students to drop by and ask questions, get to know us, and learn more about data science! If for some reason these times do not work, or you wish to meet privately, please reach out using our contact info.</p>

<p><strong>Section Times</strong><br>
There wil be no <em>section times</em>. Section hours have been turned into extra office hours (listed above). This allows students that may not be able to make section times (due to time zones, work,  family constraints, and so on) to join discussions and ask questions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Final exam date</strong>: No final exam, only final project deadline.</li>
<li>There are 400 possible points to be earned in this course. To determine your final grade, you will add up all of the points for the above categories and divide your grade by 4. Your letter grade will be determined using the <a href="https://pages.stolaf.edu/dietz/typical-grading-scale/_">standard grading scale</a>. Grades are not rounded up, that’s why we included 10 bonus points.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grades</strong><br>
Grades will be released on Canvas within a week after the submission date, often sooner. We will try to send out automated alerts if we do not receive a submission and/or if it fails to be processed, but ultimately it is your responsibility to check your grades and get in touch if any are missing or you think there is a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment Regrades</strong><br>
We will work hard to grade everyone fairly and return assignments quickly. But, we know you also work hard and want you to receive the grade you’ve earned. Occasionally, grading mistakes do happen, and it&rsquo;s important to us to correct them.
If you think there is a mistake in your grade, please use Gradescope’s regrade request feature to alert us. Please do this within 72 hours and include a few sentences as evidence for why you think your answer was correct (i.e. a specific reference to something said in lecture).</p>
<p><strong>Lecture Attendance</strong><br>
Our goal is to make lecture and discussion section worth your while to attend. However, with the current format of online classes and students potentially being in different time zones, lecture attendance is not required. We will make every effort to record lecture and all guest lectures in case you are unable to attend. Guest lectures are also important to watch because not only will they contain practical real-world info from a data science practitioner, but test questions may be generated from guest lecture material.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion Section Attendance</strong><br>
Discussion section has been removed inlight of Covid-19. Students are dispersed across different time zones and we want to allow each and every student to attend group discussion sections and ask questions about the material. We are therefore adding 8 additional office hours throughout the week. See below for more info.</p>
<p><strong>Office Hours</strong><br>
We are providing office hours on the weekend, late at night and in the morning. These hours will be used to discuss readings, to get hands-on practice/guidance with projects, and to guide your interest in data science. The assignments throughout the quarter will be used to guide and provide feedback for your final project.Office hours are the perfect time to go over the feedback and gain a firmer understanding of the course content.</p>
<p>Attendance to office hours is not required. However, we would love to see everyone attend at least one office hour session  per week. If for some reason you are unable to attend any of the hours, or are having additional issues, please reach out through Piazza, or email. We are able, and more than happy, to set up additional 1:1 or 1:group meetings with students.</p>
<p>Finally, office hours are a great place for students and instructors to personally interact. We are really interested in hearing about your personal/professional goals, career endeavours, and generally what you want to gain from taking this course. Remember, office hours are not just for going over class questions, but it’s a great place to learn more about current tools, the ins and outs of the field, and what it’s like to work as a data scientist.</p>
<h3 id="course-assignments--topics">Course Assignments &amp; Topics</h3>
<p>This class is a survey course intended to get you all excited about becoming data scientists! Data are everywhere and they’re being used in tried-and-true, new, awesome, and creative ways. This course will introduce you to topics in data science, discuss what it means to be a data scientist, and get you on your way to thinking like a data scientist. To see what topics will be introduced in this course, see the calendar at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Assignments</strong><br>
There are four group assignments. Groups must consist of 4-5 people. Groups are typically formed in sections. However because everyone will be virtually attending, we will randomly assign groups during the first few days of class. Group assignments will be sent out to students over piazza. Assignments will focus on applying the concepts covered in lecture and ensuring you’re on the right track for your final project.</p>
<p>Assignments will be submitted on Gradescope. (We’ll talk about the details for submission in class.) One assignment per group will be submitted. You will receive feedback along with a grade within three days from submission. Feedback from us should be incorporated into subsequent assignments.</p>
<p>Late assignments earn a max of 30 credits (10 points deducted within 72 hours late; no late assignments accepted after 72 hours).</p>
<p><strong>Final Project</strong><br>
The final project is a report on how you would handle a complicated data science project. It’s essentially a culmination of the four assignments all tied together in a nice report. Like the assignments, this report will be submitted as a Jupyter notebook. It will include all the nitty gritty, whys, and hows of the analysis you have chosen. You’ll write about your data science question, find and wrangle data that could be used to answer the question, carry out a descriptive analysis, and describe the analysis you would carry out to answer your question of interest. You WON’T have to actually perform the final part of the analysis to answer the question, just write about it. But if you do make it that far, and can present results, that’s great and will be taken into account (in the form of extra credit on this assignment).</p>
<p><strong>Exams</strong><br>
There will be two multiple choice exams covering material in lecture (including guest lectures!) and the readings discussed in section. These exams will be taken at home and you will have 24 hours to complete it, open notes and open resources. You may not work together on the exams. We will check piazza/email periodically during the exam time to answer questions.</p>
<p><strong>Readings</strong><br>
Due to the accelerated timeline for a summer course, readings and their accompanying quiz will be due on Gradescope, weekly on Friday by 11:59pm PST, with the exception of the first two readings, due on Sunday at 11:59pm. New readings will be made available immediately following the previous reading’s due date. Reading quizzes are timed (60 minutes), and you only have one attempt. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped when calculating your final grade.</p>
<p>Readings will be discussed in office hours each week before their due date. Allowing for questions to be asked before quizzes.</p>
<p>Late reading quizzes will be accepted up to 72 hours, however they will receive a max of 10 points, so ½ credit.</p>

<h3 id="other-good-stuff">Other Good Stuff</h3>
<p><strong>Class/Web Conduct</strong><br>
In all interactions in this class, you are expected to be respectful. This includes following the UC San Diego <a href="https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html">principles of community</a>.</p>
<p>This class will be a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices.</p>
<p>At all times, you should be considerate and respectful. Always refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Last of all, take care of each other.</p>
<p>If you have a concern, please speak with Kyle, or your TAs. If you are uncomfortable doing so, that’s ok! The <a href="https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/policies/sexual/OPHD.html">OPHD</a> (Office for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Discrimination) and <a href="https://care.ucsd.edu/">CARE</a> (confidential advocacy and education office for sexual violence and gender-based violence) are wonderful resources on campus.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity</strong><br>
Don&rsquo;t cheat.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to (and at times will have to) work together and help one another. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit. For assignments, it is also your responsibility to ensure you understand everything your group has submitted and to make sure the correct file has been uploaded, that the upload is uncorrupted, and that it renders correctly. Projects may include ideas and code from other sources—but these other sources must be documented with clear attribution. Please review academic integrity policies <a href="http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu">here</a>.</p>
<p>We anticipate you all doing well in this course; however, if you are feeling lost or overwhelmed, that’s ok! Should that occur, we recommend: (1) asking questions in/after class, (2) attending office hours and/or (3) asking for help on Piazza (4) reaching out to course staff.</p>
<p>Cheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, Canvas, or Gradescope is down, or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact me by emailing your assignment to me (<a href="kshannon@ucsd.edu">kshannon@ucsd.edu</a> with subject line “Cogs9”), or else it will be graded as late.</p>

<p><strong>How to Get Your Question(s) Answered and/or Provide Feedback</strong><br>
It’s great that we have so many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.</p>
<p>That said, to ensure that we’re respecting their time, TAs and IAs have been instructed they’re only obligated to answer questions between normal working hours (M-F 9am-5pm). However, I know that’s not when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to post whenever is best for you while knowing that if you post late at night or on a weekend, you may not get a response until the next day. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question.</p>
<p>If you have…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>questions about course content</strong> - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too….so post these to Piazza!</li>
<li><strong>questions about course logistics</strong> - first, check the syllabus. If the answer is not there, check or post on Piazza or ask a classmate.</li>
<li><strong>questions about a grade</strong> - use Gradescope’s regrade feature within 72 hours.</li>
<li><strong>something super cool to share related to class</strong> - feel free to email Kyle <a href="kshannon@ucsd.edu">kshannon@ucsd.edu</a>) or come to office hours. Be sure to include COGS9 in the email subject line and your full name in your message.</li>
<li><strong>something you want to talk about in-depth</strong> - meet in person/digitally during office hours or schedule a time to meet 1:1 by email. Be sure to include COGS9 in the email subject line. Or it may be missed. <a href="kshannon@ucsd.edu">kshannon@ucsd.edu</a>.</li>
<li><strong>some feedback about the course you want to share anonymously</strong> - If you been offended by an example in class, really liked or really disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn’t but would rather not share this publicly, etc., please fill out the anonymous <a href="https://forms.gle/ivEJdGSdjv4uHJEcA">Google Form</a>*</li>
