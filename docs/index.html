<h4 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h4>
<p>This class is still remote, and students may not all be in San Diego. We want all to give all students an opportunity to join, therefore office hours will be spread throughout the week to include early morning, midday, night-time, and weekend hours. If for some reason these times do not work, or you wish to meet privately, please reach out after class or through email.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Final exam date</strong>: No final exam, only a final group project.</li>
<li>Your letter grade will be determined using the <a href="https://pages.stolaf.edu/dietz/typical-grading-scale/">standard grading scale</a>. Grades are not rounded up, that’s why we included 10 bonus points.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="grades">Grades</h4>
<p>Grades will be released on Canvas within a week after the submission date, often sooner. Ultimately it is your responsibility to check your final grade and get in touch if any are missing or you think there is a problem.</p>
<h4 id="regrade-policy">Regrade Policy</h4>
<p>The regrade policy is here to protect students from serious issues in grading, not to provide students with a platform to argue about, or plead for an extra point. A grader may incorrectly take off a 1-2 points, but they are also just as likely to give students 1-2 points. In our experience less than 5% of the time a regrade actually results in an increased score. When we regrade, we closely go through the entire assignment again and reevaluate it as a whole. This is not to discourage students from requesting legitimate regrades, but to discourage students from arguing about a 1-2 points (which is worth .0025% of your grade). These discussions require a serious investment of time. We want to spend that time on regrades where a serious issue has occurred, or with helping students learn the material better.</p>
<p><strong>If you think such an error has occurred please follow these steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have 72 hours to request a regrade</li>
<li>Initiate the regrade through Gradescope (if it is a group project, confer w/ your team first and only submit one regrade after your team comes to a concensus)</li>
<li>Provide evidence for why your answer is correct and merits a regrade (i.e. a specific reference to something said in lecture, the readings, or office hours)</li>
<li>We will get back to you within 48 hours with our final decision. Your score will be lowered, stay the same, or increased based on a whole regrade of the assignment, quiz, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="lecture-attendance">Lecture Attendance</h4>
<p>Our goal is to make lecture and office hours worth your while to attend. However, with the current format of online classes and students potentially being in different time zones, lecture attendance is not required. We will make every effort to record all lectures (including guest lectures) and post it same day. Exam questions may be generated from guest lecture content.</p>
<h4 id="section-attendance">Section Attendance</h4>
<p>Discussion section has been removed due to Covid-19. Students may be dispersed across different time zones and each student may not be able to attend group discussion sections and ask questions about the material. We are therefore adding several additional office hours throughout the week. See below for more info.</p>
<h4 id="office-hours-1">Office Hours</h4>
<p>We are providing office hours on the weekend, late at night and in the morning. These hours will be used to discuss readings, to get hands-on practice/guidance with projects, and to guide your interest in data science. Office hours are the perfect time to go over assignment feedback and gain a firmer understanding of the course content.</p>
<p>Office hour attendance is not required. However, we would love to see everyone attend at least one office hour session. If you are unable to make an office hour session and or are having additional issues, please reach out after class or through email. We are more than happy, to set up additional 1:1 or 1:group meeting.</p>
<p>Finally, office hours are a great place to personally interact. We are interested in your goals, career endeavors, and what you want to gain from Cogs 9. Remember, office hours are not only for class material, but also discussing the field of DataSci, Machine Learning and analytics. It&rsquo;s a rapidly changing field and there is always a lot to discuss.</p>
<h3 id="course-assignments--topics">Course Assignments &amp; Topics</h3>
<p>This class is a survey course intended to get you all excited about becoming data scientists! Data are everywhere and they’re being used in tried-and-true, new, awesome, and creative ways. This course will introduce you to topics in data science, discuss what it means to be a data scientist, and get you on your way to thinking like a data scientist. To see what topics will be introduced in this course, see the calendar on Canvas.</p>
<h4 id="assignments">Assignments</h4>
<p>There are four group assignments. Groups typically consist of 3-5 people. Through Canvas we will randomly assign groups during the first few days of class. Students may drop or join late thus we may need to add or remove students from groups within the first week. We appreciate your flexibility and will take into account these potential shifting circumstances when grading the first assignment. Assignments will focus on applying the concepts covered in lecture and readings to ensure you’re on the right track for your final project.</p>
<p>Assignments will be submitted on Gradescope. (We’ll talk about the details for submission in class.) One assignment per group will be submitted. You will receive feedback along with a grade within three days from submission. Feedback from us should be incorporated into subsequent assignments.</p>
<p>Late assignments earn a max of either 30/40 or 20/40 points (10 points deducted within the first 24 hours, an additional 10 points after that) no late assignments accepted after 48 hours).</p>
<h4 id="final-project">Final Project</h4>
<p>The final project is a report on how you would handle a complicated data science project. It’s essentially a culmination of the four assignments all tied together in a nice report. Like the assignments, this report will be submitted as a Jupyter notebook. It will include all the nitty gritty, whys, and hows of the analysis you have chosen. You’ll write about your data science question, find and wrangle data that could be used to answer the question, carry out a descriptive analysis, and describe the analysis you would carry out to answer your question of interest. You <strong>WON’T</strong> have to actually perform the final part of the analysis (programming/statistical analysis) to answer the question, just write about how you would perform the analysis and what you expect the outcomes will be. More info on this in class.</p>
<h4 id="exam">Exam</h4>
<p>There will be one multiple choice exam. This exam will cover lecture (including guest lectures) and reading material that you have completed. The exam will be available for 48 hours. Once you begin the exam you will have 3 straight hours to complete it. The three hours must be continuous.  Open notes are fine, but you may not work together. I will provide a partly completed study guide, as well as perform an exam review session after class (recorded).</p>
<h4 id="readings">Readings</h4>
<p>Reading quizzes will be available for 48 hours and you will only have one attempt. Once you begin, you will have 60 minutes to complete the quiz. It is open notes, but you must work alone. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped when calculating your final grade. Late reading quizzes will be accepted up to 48 hours, however they will receive a max of 10/20 points, i.e. ½ credit.</p>

<h3 id="other-good-stuff">Other Good Stuff</h3>
<h4 id="classweb-conduct">Class/Web Conduct</h4>
<p>In all interactions in this class, you are expected to be respectful. This includes following the UC San Diego <a href="https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html">principles of community</a>.</p>
<p>This class will be a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices.</p>
<p>At all times, you should be considerate and respectful. Always refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Last of all, take care of each other.</p>
<p>If you have a concern, please speak with Kyle, or your TAs. If you are uncomfortable doing so, that’s ok! The <a href="https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/policies/sexual/OPHD.html">OPHD</a> (Office for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Discrimination) and <a href="https://care.ucsd.edu/">CARE</a> (confidential advocacy and education office for sexual violence and gender-based violence) are wonderful resources on campus.</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h4>
<p>Don&rsquo;t cheat.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to (and at times will have to) work together and help one another. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit. For assignments, it is also your responsibility to ensure you understand everything your group has submitted and to make sure the correct file has been uploaded, that the upload is uncorrupted, and that it renders correctly. Projects may include ideas and code from other sources—but these other sources must be documented with clear attribution. Please review academic integrity policies <a href="http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu">here</a>.</p>
<p>We anticipate you all doing well in this course; however, if you are feeling lost or overwhelmed, that’s ok! Should that occur, we recommend: (i.) asking questions in/after class, (ii.) attending office hours and/or (iii.) reaching out to course staff via email.</p>
<p>Cheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, Canvas, or Gradescope is down, or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact me by emailing your assignment to me (<a href="kshannon@ucsd.edu">kshannon@ucsd.edu</a> with subject line “Cogs9”), or else it will be graded as late.</p>
<h4 id="disability-access">Disability​ ​Access</h4>
<p>Students requesting accommodations due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. To arrange accommodations please contact Kyle <a href="kshannon@ucsd.edu">kshannon@ucsd.edu</a> privately.</p>
<p>Contacting the OSD can help you further:

<h4 id="questions--feedback">Questions &amp; Feedback</h4>
<p><strong>How to Get Your Question(s) Answered and/or Provide Feedback</strong><br>
It’s great that we have many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.</p>
<p>That said, to ensure that we’re respecting their time, TAs and IAs have been instructed they’re only obligated to answer questions between normal working hours (M-F 9am-5pm). However, I know that’s not when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to reach out whenever is best for you while knowing that, you may not get a response until the next day. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question. If there is an emergency and you need to contact staff immediately, email Kyle and put &ldquo;EMERGENCY-COGS9&rdquo; in the subject line. I will get back to you ASAP.</p>
<p>If you have…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>questions about course content</strong> - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered, please post questions to Canvas, or ask during class/office hours.</li>
<li><strong>questions about course logistics</strong> - first, check the syllabus. If the answer is not there, check or post on Canvas, ask a classmate, or ask during class/office hours.</li>
<li><strong>something super cool to share related to class</strong> - feel free to email Kyle <a href="kshannon@ucsd.edu">kshannon@ucsd.edu</a>) or come to office hours. Be sure to include COGS9 in the email subject line and your full name in your message.</li>
<li><strong>something you want to talk about in-depth</strong> - meet in person/digitally during office hours or schedule a time to meet 1:1 by email. Be sure to include COGS9 in the email subject line. Or it may be missed. <a href="kshannon@ucsd.edu">kshannon@ucsd.edu</a>.</li>
